### This module follows the error flag convention provided for QC'd CoMeT data. README and all QC as of Sep. 2025 has been provided and performed by
### Dr. Adam Houston at UNL.
### Created 23 September 2025 by Kyle Brooks.

### Blank now, but intended to separate off error handling from flags into separate module so raw data will be relatively unaffected if the user wishes.
